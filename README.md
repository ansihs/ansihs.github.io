Arrow hero

A minimalist game where your goal is to match your inputs with an unstoppable continuous overwelming flow of arrows.

Setting up Gulp
---

First, clone this repository (you can fork it too):
```shell
git clone git@github.com:AcelisWeaven/arrow-hero.git
```

Then, we need to install our dependencies:
```shell
yarn install
```

Finally, let's start the dev server:
```shell
yarn serve
```

You can also build the project, if you want to release it yourself.
```shell
yarn build
```
